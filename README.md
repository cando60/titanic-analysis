# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover patterns in survival rates. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using Python. The goal is to demonstrate data science skills for portfolio purposes.

## 📁 Project Files

- `titanic.csv` — The dataset containing passenger information
- `titanic.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis and visualizations
- `titanic.py` — Python script version of the analysis

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations
- Visualize survival patterns based on features like gender, age, class, and fare
- Build and evaluate predictive models to estimate survival likelihood

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas** — for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** — for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** — for machine learning models (if used)

## 📊 Key Insights

- Women and children had significantly higher survival rates
- Passengers in first class were more likely to survive than those in lower classes
- Fare and age also showed correlations with survival probability

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of a personal portfolio to showcase data analysis and machine learning skills using real-world datasets.
